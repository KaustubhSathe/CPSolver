# Codeforces

This extension lets you solve codeforces problems directly from VS Code.
Inspired from this extension [Leetcode](https://github.com/jdneo/vscode-leetcode).

Currently I haven't published this on the marketplace so you will have to install it from vsix. [Link Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lHlZbhUIFJdJqt3mari-LKrYr0_5qaKv/view?usp=sharing)
Make sure you have Nodejs installed on your system.

#### Features :- 
- Submit problem to codeforces
- Recommends Problems for practice which uses [Codedrils](https://recommender.codedrills.io/) in the backend (parses recommended problems from it)
- Sort problems by difficulty or number of submissions
- Get problems by tags,difficulty or your favorite problems(Use codeforces api)

#### Current issues :-
 - Problem parsing not done MAJOR PROBLEM!!!
 - Ugly webview UI
 - Major refactoring required



**Note** : Currently in prototype phase the extension will be buggy, 
code is not readable and maintainable as of now, I will refactor it soon. Some new features will be added in future.
